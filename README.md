# Understanding the impact of numerical solvers on inference for differential equation models

## Installation and usage

The dependencies for all figures except Figure 9 are located in requirements.txt.

To run the simulations for Figure 9 requires the pystreamflow python package. This can be obtained on github here: https://github.com/pints-team/differential-equations-inference-db/tree/hydrology-model/streamflow

All simulations can be performed by running `python run_simulations.py`.

The Figures 7 and 8 can be generated using the following fork: https://github.com/rccreswell/covid19_inference_forecast, using the `ode/run_simulation.py`, `ode/run_inference.py`, and `ode/plot_inference.py` scripts.
